/**
 * Reading contract state off a HyperBEAM node, over plain HTTP.
 *
 * This service only ever READS. Under the D4 design a read is an unsigned GET against the
 * process's own device — no signing, no scheduled message, no new slot — so it needs none of
 * the ANS-104 machinery that @anyone-protocol/ao-client exists to provide. Depending on the
 * client for this pulled in @dha-team/arbundles (7MB: the whole @ethersproject v5 stack,
 * arweave, keccak, secp256k1) alongside the ethers v6 this service already used, to sign
 * nothing. So the read is inlined here instead, and there is no AO dependency to maintain.
 *
 * Keep this file read-only. If a write is ever needed, take the dependency rather than
 * growing a signer here — that is the line the seven divergent send-aos-message.ts copies
 * crossed.

 * Invoke a contract view: `GET <node>/<pid>~process@1.0/as/<name>[?params]`.
 * This is the replacement for a legacynet `dryrun` carrying an `Action` tag.
 *
 * ⚠️ `as/`, NOT `now/~lua@5.3a/` — load-bearing since the contracts moved their state into Lua
 * globals (D32). `now` resolves FIRST and hands the Lua device a priv-stripped message, so it
 * re-initialises a FRESH VM from the module: the view function is present and callable, but
 * every data global is nil. The result is HTTP 200 with EMPTY state — a silent wrong answer,
 * not an error. `as/` applies the execution device to the LOADED process instead.
 *
 * This service keeps its own reader rather than depending on @anyone-protocol/ao-client, so a
 * change to the read path has to be made in both places. ao-client made the same change in
 * v0.1.3.
